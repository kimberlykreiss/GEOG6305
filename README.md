# GEOG6305

This repository contains code to prepare spatial data for graduate-level Geospatial Statistics at GWU. 
I combine county-level data to analyze (1) spatial distribution of bank branches nationally; 
(2) the spatial distribution of bank branch closures between 2012 and 2017 nationally; and (3) how bank branch closures affect mortgage originations.
