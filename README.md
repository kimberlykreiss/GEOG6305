# GEOG6305

This repository contains code to prepare spatial data for graduate-level Geospatial Statistics at GWU. 
I combine county-level data to analyze (1) spatial distribution of bank branches nationally; 
(2) the spatial distribution of bank branch closures between 2012 and 2017 nationally; and (3) how bank branch closures affect mortgage originations.

Data from 2012 and 2017 are combined to make a county-level dataset to analyze these topics. Bank branch data come from FDIC's Summary of Deposits (SOD) data, mortgage data come from Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, and demographic data come from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year estimates.
